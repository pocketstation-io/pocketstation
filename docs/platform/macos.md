# macOS capture

<!-- claims: CLM-DOC-044-CAP-001,CLM-DOC-044-CAP-002,CLM-DOC-044-CAP-003,CLM-DOC-044-CAP-004,CLM-DOC-044-SOURCE-001 -->

## Scope

- **Capture application audio.** Prepare application-scoped capture through the platform backend selected for the current target.
- **Capture microphone audio.** Select the default or identified input device and open native microphone capture.
- **Capture system audio.** Represent and open platform system-loopback capture where the selected backend implements it.
- **Observe permission and source lifecycle.** Query non-prompting authorization where observable and receive source-generation, loss, and permission-epoch changes.

The scope of **macOS capture** ends at the native contracts and executable conditions cited below. Platform qualification, performance, retry, and delivery require their own explicit evidence.

## Permission and source opening

For **macOS capture**, permission observation and source opening remain separate. The host application owns prompts and selection UI. A non-prompting observation is advisory where implemented; preparation or open returns the authoritative result.

## Qualification boundary

The target-specific files, Cargo dependencies, and CI cited by **macOS capture** establish implementation or build evidence only. They do not qualify every device, operating-system revision, packaging context, permission state, or physical path.

## Executable evidence

Executable evidence selected for **macOS capture** is limited to each test's recorded setup and assertions:

## Evidence boundary

The claims on **macOS capture** are anchored to Git snapshot `3b7b970f6598239e5d435b60c8d132a955a1886c` and these primary files:

- `src/capture/platform/macos/mod.rs:1-112` (`DIRECT`)

For **macOS capture**, direct source establishes only the recorded declaration or implementation. Tests, external fixtures, and qualification artifacts retain their narrower evidence classifications.
